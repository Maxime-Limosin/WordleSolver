I like Wordle, but Wordle doesn't like me....

## Context
If you don't know [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), it's a small game where you have to guess a 5 letters word each day. Whenever you input a guess, the game will tell you if you fond one of the word letter (yellow), one of the word letter at the right place (green) or if the letter doesn't belong to the word (grey). You have a limited amount of tries to solve the game, and despite liking it, I'm really bad. So I made this small project to create a solver, so that I could flex before my friends that have a 200 IQ brain (what I obviously don't have).

I tried to have fun and included a GlassPanel QML Component to create a nice looking app.

## How to build
I used QtCreator with Q5.15 for this project. You can download them [here](https://www.qt.io/development/download-qt-installer-oss).
